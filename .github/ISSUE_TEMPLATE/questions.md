This Github repository is maintained primarily by a single person. If you wish he still has time to breathe, please do him a favor to ask questions in a public forum such as Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/tags/rmarkdown) or RStudio Community (https://community.rstudio.com). Hopefully your question will be seen by a lot more people (> 1 for sure), and answered more quickly.

If you have a question that is very specific to this particular Github repository, please feel free to ask, though. Thanks for your understanding!

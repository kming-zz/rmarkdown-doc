Suggestions on improving the existing chapters/sections are always welcome. Or even better, you may edit the source files and submit a pull request, in which case please include a statement if the contribution is nontrivial (e.g. not simply fixing a typo):

> I assign the copyright of this contribution to the authors of the book "R Markdown: The Definitive Guide".

You may also suggest new topics to us. Thanks!
